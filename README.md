# blot codes
i made this repo so i can upload my arts from https://blot.hackclub.dev to here
these are made for sheer self indulgence so dont expect anything impressive lol

## bunnyblot.png
my first blot code that i planned to add as a PR to blot's GH. but it turns out my art needed to be generative so i couldnt submit it...

at the time i didnt know it was possible to download the drawing as SVG/PNG/JS, so i dont have the code for it! but it was around 200 lines of code

## lampda
my first actual blot code! this appears in blot's art directory as "lampda_snipchu"
this one took like 4 hours to make and has maybe one too many variables.. but it was so worth it in the end :)
